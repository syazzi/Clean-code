As u can see the bad code is showing that everything is being publicised that everyone can see whats inside of the important aspect in coding that should be concealed. To make the software more secure it is important to hide the codes that can reveal privacy and we call this private variables and private methods. in example 4 bad code we can see the password that is inputed by the user, where else in the good code we have privatised the password variable so that no one can access the password field.
