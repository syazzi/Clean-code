in the example 2 bad code, as u can see there are a lots of arguments and indetations of if-else statments. to make the code cleaner it is better tomake it less than 5 lines of code. we can do this by creating functions. the functions must also led to another functions this is so that we can try to make every functions do a single things and has less than 5 lines of code.
