in the example 2 bad code, as u can see there are a lots of arguments and indetations of if-else statments. to make the code cleaner it is better tomake it less than 5 lines of code. we can do this by creating functions. the functions must also led to another functions this is so that we can try to make every functions do a single things and has less than 5 lines of code.

in example 2 good code i have created a class with several of functions that online consist of 2 - 3 lines of code. most of the functions only do one task and the get_browser function have at leaste 2 arguments which is quite sufficient. for a clean code every functions must not have more than 4 arguments and 5 lines of code. this shows that the code is easier to read there arent a lot of indentation needed.
